Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router and Context.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Read, Create, Update and Delete contacts.

## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

1. Do not clone this repository.The first step to start coding is cloning the [react boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello) on your local computer or gitpod.

a) If using Gitpod you can clone the boilerplate by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello).

b) If working locally type the following command from your command line: `$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello`.

ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

2. Install the /node_modules
```
$ npm install
```
3. Run the webpack development server
```
$ npm run start
```

This boilerplate contains no real functionalities but it has 99.99% of the HTML/CSS that you'll need for the project, allowing you to focus on the functionality.

**Please use the Context for this project:** The boilerplate comes with the Context configured. Check the ```/store``` folder.

**Note: You'll need to code all functionalities.**

### :memo:This project is divided in: 

#### :two: different views: 

1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form used to create or update contacts.

#### One component:
ContactCard: displays just one contact.

## TO-DO functionalities

- You have to add the code needed to make your application handle contacts, specifically: 
    - create, 
    - update, 
    - and delete.
- (Optional) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the Modal component for that.

All the functionalities must be implemented in the ```actions``` object (store.js).

Hint: start with some dummy content in the store (store.js).

```Fetch``` the data from the API: https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/fake/contact/

Hint: Use Postman to try the API endpoints before coding.  



That is it! Start coding your React Application :)
